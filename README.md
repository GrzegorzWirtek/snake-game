Snake game created using OOP in **JavaScript.js**, **HTML** and **CSS**.

Play the game: **[Snake Game](https://grzegorzwirtek.github.io/snake-game/)**

## General info

I created the game to practice and develop the object-oriented programming in JS and to improve logical thinking skills. The game involves collecting food that appears on the board in random places. Hovering over food adds a point to the player and another item to the snake's body. The game ends when the snake slides over the edge of the board or onto its own body. The user can set the speed of the snake before the game starts.
